Linkin Park,"It starts with

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
Or wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how

I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised

It got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter"
Linkin Park,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so numb, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so numb, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so numb, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be"
Linkin Park,"Graffiti decorations
Under the sky of dust
A constant wave of tension
On top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me
I learned were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

Paper bags and angry voices
Under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension
Has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action
These words were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I'm gonna run away, and never say goodbye
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind"
Linkin Park,"Why does it feel like night today? 
Something in here's not right today.
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left 
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed 
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
Like a face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus]
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too and
Your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can but
Everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you too 
Right inside your skin

[Chorus: x2]

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

[Chorus]

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin"
Linkin Park,"Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

You love the things I say I'll do
The way I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race

Linkin Park,"Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes I need you to stay away from me
Sometimes I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow I need you to go

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay

Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself
Sometimes I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow I need to be alone

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay

I don't need you anymore, don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day, of you wasting me away
I don't need you anymore, I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day, of you wasting me away
(With no apologies)

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
(Just give me myself back control)
Don't stay
Don't stay
Don't stay"
Linkin Park,"When this began,
I had nothing to say 
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused)
And I let it all out to find that I'm not the only person with these things in mind (inside of me)
But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I got left to feel (nothing to lose)
Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own,
And the fault is my own

I want to heal, I want to feel,
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long (erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face (I was confused) 
Looking everywhere only to find that it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind (so what am I?)
What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me (nothing to lose)
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own,
And the fault is my own

I want to heal, I want to feel,
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I've held so long (erase all the pain 'till it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel,
Anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be
Anything 'til I break away from me
And I will break away, and find myself today

I want to heal, I want to feel
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long (erase all the pain til it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel,
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I want to heal I want to feel like I'm,
Somewhere I belong,
I want to heal I want to feel like I'm somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong"
Linkin Park,"When I pretend
Everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend
I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just cause I know I can, but
I can't pretend this is the way it will stay, I'm just
Trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm
Lying my way from you

(no, no turning back now)
I want to be pushed aside
So let me go
(no, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life
I'd rather be all alone
(no turning back now)
Anywhere on my own
Cause I can see
(no, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you
Is me

I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in
And now you think this person really is me and I'm
(trying to bend the truth)
But the more I push
The more I'm pulling away
'cause I'm

Lying my way from you

(no, no turning back now)
I want to be pushed aside
So let me go
(no, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life
I'd rather be all alone
(no turning back now)
Anywhere on my own
Cause I can see
(no, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you
Is me

This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me
Like this

This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me
Like this

This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me
Like this

This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me
Like this

You
(no turning back now)
I want to be pushed aside
So let me go
(no, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life
I'd rather be all alone
(no turning back now)
Anywhere on my own
Cause I can see
(no, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you
Is me"
Linkin Park,"I don't know who to trust your surprise
(Everyone feels so far away from me)
Happy thoughts sift through dust and the lies
(Trying not to break but I'm so tired of this deceit)

(Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
(All I ever think about is this)
(All the tiring time between)
(And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me)

Take everything from the inside and throw it all away
'cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you

Tension is building inside steadily
(Everyone feels so far away from me)
Happy thoughts forcing their way out of me
(Trying not to break but I'm so tired of this deceit)
(Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet)
(All I ever think about is this)
(All the tiring time between)
(And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me)

Take everything from the inside and throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you

I won't waste myself on you
You
You
Waste myself on you
You
You

I'll take everything from the inside and throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you

Everything from the inside and just throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you
You
You"
Linkin Park,"I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored

I am, a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can
But sometimes I don't make sense
I am, what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do
You face away and pretend I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored

You hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored

I can't feel

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

Linkin Park,"I got a long way to go
And a long memory
I've been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I've been searching for the courage
To face my enemies

When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground

When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony"
Linkin Park,"Don't you hold your breath 
'Cause I'm not coming down
The battlefields have left me only scars
And floating in the dark
I'm swimming in the sound
Of voices that should never been apart

Darker than the blood (Darker than the blood)
Higher than the sun (Higher than the sun)
This is not the end (This is not the end)
You are not the only one (You are not the only one)

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Waiting for the light that never comes

Waiting for a light that never comes"
Linkin Park,"I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end you'll soon find)

Why I played myself this way'
Now I see, your testing me, pushes me away, pushes me away"
Linkin Park,"Graffiti decorations
Under the sky of dust
A constant wave of tension
On top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me
I learned were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

Paper bags and angry voices
Under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension
Has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action
These words were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I'm gonna run away, and never say goodbye
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind
Gonna run away, gonna run away

Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye

Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong

Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoe’s
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's, gang

I've been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I've been searching for the courage
To face my enemies

When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground

When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony

Used to get high with the dead end kids
Abandoned houses where the shadows live
I never been higher than I was that night
I woke up driving my car
I couldn’t see then what I see right now
The road dissolving like an an empty vow
Couldn’t remember where I’ve been that night
I knew that I took it too far

All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

I don’t lose, I don’t win, if I’m wrong, then I’m halfway right

Told me kid you’re going way too fast
You burn too bright, you know you’ll never last
It was bullshit then, I guess it makes sense now
I woke up driving my car
Said I'd lose you if I lost control
I just laughed because what do they know?
Here I am, standing all alone
Because I took it too far

Should’ve played safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart

Never could’ve planned
They made me who I am

Put your nose on paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes
These years you’re never getting back

These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling
I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced
That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again
My walls are closing in

Confusing, confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming (confusing what is real)
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling (confusing what is real)"
Linkin Park,"I dreamed I was missing
You were so scared
But no one would listen
Cause no one else cared
After my dreaming
I woke with this fear
What am I leaving
When I'm done here?
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating
I've shared what I've made
I'm strong on the surface
Not all the way through
I've never been perfect
But neither have you
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Forgetting
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
Pretending
Someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Forgetting
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
Pretending
Someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are
I can't be who you are"
Linkin Park,"It starts with
One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
Or wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how

I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised

It got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter"
Linkin Park,"We'd like to play something that we worked out for you today
In the dressing room

Mama always told me don’t you run
Don’t you run with scissors, son
You’re gonna hurt someone
Mama told me look before you leap
Always think before you speak, and watch the friends you keep

Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences
I guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences
Now every scar is a story I can tell

Should’ve played safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart
But all the things I couldn’t understand
Never could’ve planned
They made me who I am

Put your nose on paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes
These years you’re never getting back

Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences
I guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences
Now every scar is a story I can tell

We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger

Ooh
Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences
I guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences
Now every scar is a story I can tell

We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger, ooh

Man, playing guitar and singing is really hard
Dude, Mike is back here like playing drums, playing keyboards, guitars, rapping
And I'm like, oh, five thumbs
Do you wanna take a break from guitar and singing for a minute then?
What's that?
Do you wanna take a break from it then?
Oh no I like playing guitar, it's super fun
I mean if you can't have fun doing this you'r doing it wrong, you know what I mean?"
Linkin Park,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be"
Linkin Park,"Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind

Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose

Truth is you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug a trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere

Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
Go, stop the show
Choppy words in a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load

Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse

Can't contain him;
He knows he works
F*ck this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing

And I know that I won't be satisfied
So, why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirty dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now

I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
I bleed it out

Linkin Park,"When this began,
I had nothing to say 
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused)
And I let it all out to find that I'm not the only person with these things in mind (inside of me)
But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I got left to feel (nothing to lose)
Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own,
And the fault is my own

I want to heal, I want to feel,
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long (erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face (I was confused) 
Looking everywhere only to find that it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind (so what am I?)
What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me (nothing to lose)
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own,
And the fault is my own

I want to heal, I want to feel,
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I've held so long (erase all the pain 'till it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel,
Anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be
Anything 'til I break away from me
And I will break away, and find myself today

I want to heal, I want to feel
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long (erase all the pain til it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel,
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I want to heal I want to feel like I'm,
Somewhere I belong,
I want to heal I want to feel like I'm somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong"

Of voices that should never been apart

Darker than the blood
Higher than the sun
This is not the end
You are not the only one

Venom on their tongues
They'll paint it on the walls
Justice doesn't have the strength to hold
The higher than they climb
The harder they will fall
And we will break their bones until they fold

Take the hand or fist
Just to sell ourselves for this

So whatcha waiting for?
Anticipating more
While you debate
What it can take to instigate a war
Yeah, I've been hated more than
Time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fucking say
They didn't say before

You could never see it
Your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe
But this is take a shot time
You waiting for a purpose?
I already got mine
While you tell me ""step to it like
One, two, three, four""

And if I do what you demand (You say)
You'll let me understand (You say)
You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away (You say)
I'll have no debt to pay (You say)
I'm gonna get what I deserve

No more, obey
My debt repaid

All for nothing, all for nothing

Came back, there's no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for ya'
I really don't know ya'
You talk but let me show ya'
Where to put your paranoia
You joke and I don't half a half a sucker bone to throw ya

And no, I'm not your soldier
I'm not taking any orders

Need a lesson, let me show ya'
Have you checking your composure

Linkin Park,"Tell us all again
What you think we should be
What the answers are
What it is we can't see
Tell us all again
How to do what you say
How to fall in line
How there's no other way
But oh, we all know

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same

Show us all again
That our hands are unclean
That we're unprepared
That you have what we need
Show us all again
'Cause we cannot be saved
Cause the end is near
Now there's no other way
And oh, you will know

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

There's no one else to blame
Guilty all the same

Guilty all the same
You're guilty all the same

Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of being rich
If he falls off his plans, he's wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split
Nonsense the same, he didn't call for this, he's filthy
Talk team, they take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty
Anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, you claim that ain't the way that he built me
Smoke scream, we're going in flames
Know as soon as they're done what the deal be
Say it's time for things to change
We arrange that dope product we built cheap
Anything if it's more to gain
Dream, manipulated like artists, it's real deep
Until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock, to pop and radio
You record companies kill me
Try to force me to strain it, no way
They got the gall to say ""yo, how real can real be?""
You feel me? you will see, the greed will be to blame
Greedy for the fame, TV or a name
Media, the game, to me your all the same
You're guilty

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same"
Linkin Park,"One, two
One, two, thank you

There's no peace
Only war
Victory decides who's wrong or right
It will not cease
Only grow
You better be prepared to fight

And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

War

There's no pain
It will spare
Fear has become your only right
And once you're lost
In your despair
Forever black eternal night

And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

War, destroyer
War, destroyer

It needs no sign to justify
Laying down your life

War, destroyer

War"
Linkin Park,"This is war with no weapons
Marchin with no steppin'
Murder with no killin'
Illin' every direction
First, no sequel
Do the math, no equal
John with no Yoko
More power, less people

And no, I'm not afraid of that
Print it in your paperback
Every rap is made in fact
To act as a delayed attack
Every phrase a razor blade
That's saved until they play it back
To slay and leave em laying on the pavement
Bang, fade to black

In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And and there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose

In the wastelands of today
Where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today

Roll credits, you get it
The show's done
They're talking for just talking
But meaning, they got none
None of 'em come proper
They talk like a shotgun
But how many got bred with integrity?
Not one

So no, I'm not afraid
To see these suckers hold a blade to me
Ain't no way to shake the ground
I built before you came to be
Take it how you take it
I'm the opposite of vacancy
And this is not negotiation
Y'all can hate and wait and see

In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And and there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose

In the wastelands of today
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today

In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And and there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose

In the wastelands of today
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today"
Linkin Park,"A fire needs a space to burn
A breath to build a glow
I've heard it said a thousand times
But now I know

That you don't know what you've got
Oh you don't know what you've got
No you don't know what you've got
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

I thought I kept you safe and sound
I thought I made you strong
But something made me realize
That I was wrong

'Cause finding what you got sometimes
Means finding it alone
And I can finally see your light
When I let go

'Cause you don't know what you've got
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

'Cause you don't know what you've got
Oh you don't know what you've got
No you don't know what you've got
It's your battle to be fought
No you don't know what you've got
'Til it's gone
'Til it's gone
'Til it's gone"
Linkin Park,"I've seen the blood
I've seen the broken
The lost and the sights unseen
I want a flood
I want an ocean
To wash my confusion clean

I can't resolve this empty story
I can't repair the damage done

We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion

We act it out
We wear the colors
Defined by the things we own
We're not without
We're like each other
Pretending we're here alone

And far away, they burn their buildings
Right in the face of the damage done

We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion (Rebellion, rebellion)

Rebellion, rebellion
We lost before the start
Rebellion, rebellion
One by one we fall apart
We fell apart, we fell apart, we fell apart

We are the fortunate ones

Linkin Park,"There's a fragile game you play
With the ghosts of yesterday
If we can't let go, we'll never say goodbye
No trace of what remains
No stones to mark the graves
Only memories we thought we could deny

There's so much more to lose
Than the pain I put you through
In my carelessness, I left you in the dark
And the blood may wash away
But the scars will never fade
At least I know somehow I made a mark

In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right
In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right

In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right
In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right

Nothing right
Nothing right"
Linkin Park,"Tearing me apart
With words you wouldn't say
Suddenly tomorrow's
Moment washed away
Cause I don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
We both keep on waiting
For something we won't find

The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Skies begin to fade
You said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade

All I ever wanted
Secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted
The truth I couldn't speak
Cause I can't see forgiveness
And you can't see the crime
And we both keep on waiting
For what we left behind

The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Skies begin to fade
You said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade

Final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Skies begin to fade
You said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of

Linkin Park,"Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun
We laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they
They told us to go
We paid them no mind
Like every other time
But little did we know

Today, I looked for a sign
With flames in my hands
A line in the sand
Between yours and mine
And it came like fire from below
Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall
But little did you know

Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll tell them give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine

I had never been a coward
I had never seen blood
You had sold me an ocean
And I was lost in the flood
We were counting on a leader
We were driven by need
But couldn't take temptation
And we were blinded by greed
You were steady as a sniper
We were waiting on a wire
So we never saw it coming
When you ran from the fire
You can try intimidation
And you can try to ignore
But when the time comes calling
Yeah, you are gonna get yours

Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll tell them give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine

And so today, your truth has come
You’re gonna pay for what you’ve, pay for what you've done
You’ll get what’s yours, you’re out of time
And you will give me back what’s mine
Give me back what’s mine
Give me, give me back what's mine
What's mine
Give me, give me back what's mine
What's mine, what's mine
Give me back what's mine

Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun
We laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they
They told us to go
We paid them no mind
Like every other time

Linkin Park,"I'ma be that nail in your coffin
Sayin' that I soften
I was duckin' down to reload
So you can save your petty explanations
I don't have the patience

Before you even say it I know
You let your pride and your ego
Talk slick to me no
That is not the way I get down
And look at how you lose your composure
Now let me show ya exactly how the breaking point sound

I wanna see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

What is it you want me to tell ya?
I'm not the failure
I would rather live and let be
But you can't make the right kinda threat to
Push me to let you
No, you can't intimidate me
You disrespect me so clearly
Now you better hear me
That is not the way it goes down
You did it to yourself and it's over
Now let me show ya exactly how the breaking point sounds

I wanna see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

I wanna see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself

You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself

I wanna see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery"
Linkin Park,"I've seen the blood

Linkin Park,"No control
No surprise
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there
Down in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I f*ck up everything I see
Fighting in futility

It's our final war
Tell me what's worth fighting for
When we know there's nothing more
Take the hand or fist
Just to sell ourselves for this
The path we least resist

No control
No surprise
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there
Down in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I f*ck up everything I see
Fighting in futility

Uh, I give you what you came for
This is not the same though
Got a different method
But I still can bring the pain so
Not all give the same though
I got daddy's same flow
I am sock in catch you never really in my range though
Yes I'm half anglo, half huapango
On primetime, I'ma let that bass bang though
All you fucking lames go
Yelling out the names though
Careful what you shoot, cause you might hit what you came for
(Careful what you shoot, cause you might hit what you came for)

Linkin Park,"Yeah, uh
So whatcha waiting for?
Anticipating more
While you debate
What it can take to instigate a war
Yeah, I've been hated more than
Time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fucking say
They didn't say before

You could never see it
Your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe
But this is take a shot time
You waiting for a purpose?
I already got mine
While you tell me ""step to it like
One, two, three, four""

And if I do what you demand (You say)
You'll let me understand (You say)
You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away (You say)
I'll have no debt to pay (You say)
I'm gonna get what I deserve

No more, obey
My debt repaid
Our trust betrayed
All for nothing, all for nothing

Came back, there's no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for ya'
I really don't know ya'
You talk but let me show ya'
Where to put your paranoia
You joke and I don't half a half a sucker bone to throw ya
I'm disgusted by what can make you tuck your tail below ya
And no, I'm not your soldier
I'm not taking any orders
I'm a five-star general infantry controller
Need a lesson, let me show ya'
Have you checking your composure
While I make you step to it like
One, two, three, four

And if I do what you demand (You say)
You'll let me understand (You say)
You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away (You say)
I'll have no debt to pay (You say)
I'm gonna get what I deserve

Linkin Park,"Tell us all again
What you think we should be
What the answers are
What it is we can't see
Tell us all again
How to do what you say
How to fall in line
How there's no other way
But oh, we all know

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same

Show us all again
That our hands are unclean
That we're unprepared
That you have what we need
Show us all again
'Cause we cannot be saved
Cause the end is near
Now there's no other way
And oh, you will know

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

There's no one else to blame
Guilty all the same

Guilty all the same
You're guilty all the same

Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of being rich
If he falls off his plans, he's wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split
Nonsense the same, he didn't call for this, he's filthy
Talk team, they take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty
Anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, you claim that ain't the way that he built me
Smoke scream, we're going in flames
Know as soon as they're done what the deal be
Say it's time for things to change
We arrange that dope product we built cheap
Anything if it's more to gain
Dream, manipulated like artists, it's real deep
Until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock, to pop and radio
You record companies kill me
Try to force me to strain it, no way
They got the gall to say ""yo, how real can real be?""
You feel me? you will see, the greed will be to blame
Greedy for the fame, TV or a name
Media, the game, to me your all the same
You're guilty

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same"
Linkin Park,"There's no peace
Only war
Victory decides who's wrong or right
It will not cease
Only grow
You better be prepared to fight

And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

War

There's no pain
It was there
And it has become your only right
And words you lost
In your despair
Forever black each on your life

And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

War, destroy you

It needs no sign to justify
Laying down your life

War, destroy you

War"
Linkin Park,"This is war with no weapons
Marchin with no steppin'
Murder with no killin'
Illin' every direction
First, no sequel
Do the math, no equal
John with no Yoko
More power, less people

And no, I'm not afraid of that
Print it in your paperback
Every rap is made in fact
To act as a delayed attack
Every phrase a razor blade
That's saved until they play it back
To slay and leave em laying on the pavement
Bang, fade to black

In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And and there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose

In the wastelands of today
Where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today

Roll credits, you get it
The show's done
They're talking for just talking
But meaning, they got none
None of 'em come proper
They talk like a shotgun
But how many got bred with integrity?
Not one

So no, I'm not afraid
To see these suckers hold a blade to me
Ain't no way to shake the ground
I built before you came to be
Take it how you take it
I'm the opposite of vacancy
And this is not negotiation
Y'all can hate and wait and see

In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And and there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose

In the wastelands of today
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today

In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And and there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose

In the wastelands of today
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today"

You were that foundation
Never gonna be another one, no
I followed, so taken
So conditioned I could never let go
Then sorrow, then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid I couldn't let myself see
That I could never be held
Back up, no, I'll hold myself
Check the rep, yep you know my rail
Forget the rest let them know my hell
Damn, I'm back yep, my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up the vets stay their
Let the rest be to tell they tale
That I was there saying

And these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go, go, go

Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's it working out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
So you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone
I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there saying

In these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go, go, go

No, you can tell 'em all now
I don't back up, I don't back down
I don't fold up, and I don't bow
I don't roll over, don't know how
I don't care where the enemies are
Can't be stopped, all I know go hard!
Won't forget how I got this far
For every time, saying

And these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go, go, go"
Linkin Park,"Graffiti decorations
Under the sky of dust
A constant wave of tension
On top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me
I learned were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

Paper bags and angry voices
Under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension
Has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action
These words were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I'm gonna run away, and never say goodbye
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why

Linkin Park,"Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me
When it rains, it pours, when the floodgates open brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

(Oh)
'Cause I know what it's like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate

(Oh)
Night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
And I been waiting for it so long

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

Oh
Oh
Oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

When I was young, they told me, they said
Make your bed, you lie in that bed
A king can only reign 'til instead
There comes that day it's ""off with his head""

(Oh)
The night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy then when you're gone

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes

No more hiding in shadow
'Cause I won't wait for the debt to be repaid
Time has come for you

Victimized, victimized, never again victimized
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized

They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give them
As the sound comes higher on this violent rhythm
These snakes in the grass, supplying the venom
I ain't scared of your teeth, I admire what's in 'em
Keep 'em waiting in the shadows there, thinking they hidden
But the truth is you don't have the stomach to get 'em
Go on already hit 'em, yeah you gotta be kiddin'

When the lights go out and we open our eyes,
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone

This in between us is getting thinner now
Into winter now, bitter sweet
Across that horizon this sun is setting down
You're forgetting now, it's time you let me go, let me go

When the lights go out and we open our eyes,
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone

And tell them I was alone
Oh, tell me I am the only one

I just wanna die pourin'
I just wanna ride foreign
I just wanna bring hoes together
Lonny, Lisa, meet Lauren
(Wooo!) Then I be gone, keep it movin', what I be on
Damn right I know what time it is
Patek Philippe and the Tourbillion (Yuugh!)
I'm stylin' on 'em, I'm swervin' on 'em
I know it's wrong, but life's a bitch and she turn me on!

Yeah, and to each his own
Hand me some that reefer dome
Is the way I flip when the beat come on
I gonna pop that shit 'til your speakers blown
And y'all wanna cop a plea
Who you gon' talk to? Not to me
Because the chain of command work properly
You gotta earn a few stripes 'til you talk to me

I was duckin' down to reload
So you can save your petty explanations
I don't have the patience

Before you even say it I know
You let your pride and your ego
Talk slick to me no
That is not the way I get down
And look at how you lose your composure
Now let me show ya exactly how the breaking point sound

I wanna see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

What is it you want me to tell ya?
I'm not the failure
I would rather live and let be
But you can't make the right kinda threat to
Push me to let you
No, you can't intimidate me
You disrespect me so clearly
Now you better hear me
That is not the way it goes down
You did it to yourself and it's over
Now let me show ya exactly how the breaking point sounds

I wanna see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

I wanna see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies

Weep not for paths left lone
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain I've known

Give up your heart left broken
And let that mistake pass on
'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost 
And in time you'll be glad it's gone

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa

Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end and if you need a friend, 
There's a seat here alongside me

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Linkin Park,"You hid your skeletons when I had shown you mine
You woke the devil that I thought you'd left behind
I saw the evidence, the crimson soaking through
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

And you held it all but you were careless to let it fall
You held it all and I was by your side, powerless

I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end
I'm left with emptiness that words can not defend
You'll never know what I became because of you
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

And you held it all but you were careless to let it fall
You held it all and I was by your side, powerless

And you held it all but you were careless to let it fall
You held it all and I was by your side, powerless

Powerless
Powerless
Powerless"
Linkin Park,"It goes a one, two, three

With the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style, like an eight of eight drum
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run
My momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I hold 'em both together now, tell me what I got
It's a pretty small weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it

Like that

It ain't over 'cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights
And razzle me I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier, I ain't standing next to you
I can lay it on the ground before you're even in my view
Like that

Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing
Bring me to kingdom come

This is something for your people on the block to
Blackout and rock to, give you what you need
Like Papa, who shot ya
Seperate the weak from the obsolete
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucka, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain
I ain't playing, I'm just saying
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get ill or I deliver while you quiver in your parents
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break down
You can play the bank, I'ma play the bank take down
And no mistakes now I'm coming to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?
It's like that

We swim against the rising waves
That crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more

So rest your head
It's time to sleep
And dream of what's in store
The body bends until it breaks
And sings again no more
'Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning sings no more"
Linkin Park,"Skin to bone, steel to rust
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Will tomorrow have it's way

Your deception, my disgust
When your name is finally drawn,
I'll be happy that you're gone
Ash to ashes, dust to dust.

(Aah) Ash to ashes, dust to dust
(Aah) Skin to bone and steel to rust

Right to left, left to right
Night to day and day to night
As the starlight fades to gray,
I'll be watching far away

Linkin Park,"Why does it feel like night today? 
Something in here's not right today.
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left 
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed 
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
Like a face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus]
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too and
Your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can but
Everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you too 
Right inside your skin

[Chorus: x2]

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

[Chorus]

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin"
Linkin Park,"I cannot take this anymore
I'm saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you'll say
But you'll find that out anyway
Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to, break

Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, I'm about to break!

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe

Linkin Park,"I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake Slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant And I can't bring you back

It's true the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me
I'm with you
You now I see keeping everything inside
With you
You now I see even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
And we fall to the floor The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
But when things go wrong I pretend the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake Slow to react
Even though you're close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

It's true the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me
I'm with you
You now I see keeping everything inside
With you
You now I see even when I close my eyes
With you
You now I see keeping everything inside
With you
You now I see even when I close my eyes

No
No matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I
I can't wait to see tomorrow

I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced
That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced
That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming (confusing what is real)
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling (confusing what is real)"
Linkin Park,"Graffiti decorations
Under the sky of dust
A constant wave of tension
On top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me
I learned were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

Paper bags and angry voices
Under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension
Has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action
These words were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I'm gonna run away, and never say goodbye
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind"
Linkin Park,"What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again
By myself (myself)

I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
To end things watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone
If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer
By myself (myself)

I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
To end things watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

How do you think
I've lost so much
I'm so afraid
I'm out of touch
How do you expect
I will know what to do
When all I know
Is what you tell me to

Don't you
I can't tell you how to make it
No matter what I do
How hard I
I can't seem to convince myself
I'm stuck on the outside
Don't you
I can't tell you how to make it
No matter what I do
How hard I
I can't seem to convince myself
I'm stuck on the outside

I can't hold on
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(To anything watching everything spin)
Without some failure sinking

I can't hold on
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(To anything watching everything spin)
Without some failure sinking"

Blowing through the air
If you listen carefully now you will hear
This could be the first trumpet
Might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die
Don't ask me why
Things are not the way they used to be
I won't tell no lie
One and all got to face reality now

Though I try to find the answer
To all the questions they ask
Though I know it's impossible
To go living through the past
Don't tell no lie
There's a natural mystic
Blowing through the air
Can't keep them down
If you listen carefully now you will hear
Such a natural mystic
Blowing through the air

This could be the first trumpet
Might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die
Don't ask me why
There's a natural mystic
Blowing through the air

If you listen carefully now, you will hear
There's a natural mystic

Blowing through the air
If you listen carefully now you will hear
This could be the first trumpet
Might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die
Don't ask me why
Things are not the way they used to be
I won't tell no lie
One and all got to face reality now

Though I try to find the answer
To all the questions they ask
Though I know it's impossible
To go living through the past
Don't tell no lie
There's a natural mystic
Blowing through the air
Can't keep them down
If you listen carefully now you will hear
Such a natural mystic
Blowing through the air

This could be the first trumpet
Might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die
Don't ask me why

Blowing through the air

Bob Marley,"There's a natural mystic
Blowing through the air
If you listen carefully now you will hear
This could be the first trumpet
Might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die
Don't ask me why
Things are not the way they used to be
I won't tell no lie
One and all got to face reality now

Though I try to find the answer
To all the questions they ask
Though I know it's impossible
To go living through the past
Don't tell no lie
There's a natural mystic
Blowing through the air
Can't keep them down
If you listen carefully now you will hear
Such a natural mystic
Blowing through the air

This could be the first trumpet
Might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die
Don't ask me why
There's a natural mystic
Blowing through the air
I won't tell no lie
If you listen carefully now, you will hear
There's a natural mystic
Blowing through the air"

I can't find no love
No sympathy
What kind of love

I'm on my way
To happiness
Where I can find
Some peace and rest

Might as well, might as well
I get out, I get out of hell
Hell would never be made for me
So I'll search, search 'till I'm free

'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes
To ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand

I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive

I raise my flags, don my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We'll paint it red to fit right in

Deep in my bones, straight from inside

I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes (oh)
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes (oh)
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes (oh)
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes (oh)

I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind

Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun', thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun', thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the back seat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nose bleeds

Thunder

Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder

I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night

Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life

I've been around the world and never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies but now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do

Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears

Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own

That it's left for yesterday

Please forgive me for all I've done

Imagine Dragons,"In the dark, and I’m right on the middle mark
I’m just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I’m short of the others dreams of being golden and on top
It’s not what you painted in my head
There’s so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

We all are living in a dream
But life ain’t what it seems
Oh everything’s a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything’s a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

In the eyes of a teenage crystallized
Oh, the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
And the cries from the strangers out at night
They don’t keep us up at night
We have the curtains drawn and closed

We all are living in a dream
But life ain’t what it seems
Oh everything’s a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything’s a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

I know all your reasons
To keep me from seeing
Everything is actually a mess
But now I am leaving
All of us were only dreaming
Everything is actually a mess

We all are living in a dream
But life ain’t what it seems
Oh everything’s a mess

When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit, right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the Academy a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check

This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes

Imagine Dragons,"When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale

I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes

Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside

From the floor to the floor
And the sky to the sky

Always wishing that I'll take the time but
You know that's not my speed
Only believe what I can see
I live my life in black and white
I know that's not what you would like
That's all I know, I put my mind and cruise control

I'm standing on your front porch, saying: ""Don't go""
You're lookin' at me wild saying ""Just go home"" and

Cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, late nights
And just cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out (cool out, so cool out)

All the things that you detest in me
They keep you coming back for more, you see
We make each other get a bit crazy
But you'll always be a part of me

Cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, late nights
And just cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out (cool out, so cool out)
Cool out, so cool out
(Cool out, cool out)

Send me up, send me down, send me never demigod

Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the doves to the dark of the crow
Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't want to hear about what to do, no
I don’t want to do it just to do it for you

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there’s nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel

Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
Maybe you're the same as me
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
They say the truth will set you free

Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something

I coulda gave up then but
Then again I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
You take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
You take me to the top, I'm ready for

Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'

There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless

Feel the rush way up here

We're walking the wire, love
We're gonna be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

There's nights we had that just walk away
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade

Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)

Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

Like a hunter waiting for the season

I believe it, that I was never breathing

Imagine Dragons,"Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling, it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
You take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
You take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Write down my poems for the few
That looked at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
'Til it broke up and it rained down
It rained down, like

Imagine Dragons,"Do you feel the same when I'm away from you?
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you?
We could turn around, or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes
Oh, the storm is raging against us now
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down
But we took the step, and we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We're gonna be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

There's nights we had that just walk away
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade
It's the price we pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We're gonna be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below

Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
I promise you from up above
That we'll take what comes, take what comes, love

Imagine Dragons,"I was hoping for an indication
I was seeking higher elevation
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
I've been shaken wakin' in the night light
I've been breakin' hiding from the spotlight
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay

The more I stray the less I fear
And the more I reach the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh it's calling out and I won't walk away

I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for the making changes
Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
I was there but I was always leaving
I believe it, that I was never breathing
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay

The more I stray the less I fear
And the more I reach the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh it's calling out and I won't walk away

I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for the making changes
Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life, turning pages (rise, rise up)

I'm bursting like the 4th of July 
So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life 
So embrace it and leave me to stray

I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for the making changes
Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for the making changes
Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)"
Imagine Dragons,"Took your heart, took your hand
Promised you all that I had
Hoping that you understand
I'm far from a perfect man

'Cause honey it's been a hard year
It seems like we're going nowhere
You're crying inside your bedroom
Baby I know it's not fair

Lay with me, for one more night
I promise you, I'll make it right

I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night, I'll make it up to you

I know you don't understand 
the vices that follow a man
And in your eyes I can see
the places that you'd rather be

Cause honey it's been a hard year
It seems like we're going nowhere
You're crying inside your bedroom
Baby I know it's not fair

I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night, I'll make it up to you

In my darkest hour, in the dead of the night I'll make it up to you
Your hands are mine, I'll make it up to you
Promises are nothing more than fleeting thoughts
But you, you are my life babe

I'll make it up to you (every night)
I'll make it up to you
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you)

Goodbye to yesterday

All these years I've been searching
Of who I'm supposed to be
All that time I've been wasting
It was right in front of me

I am asking for
But in the all this trouble I've met
I haven't got one single regret, no

No tomorrow without a yesterday

Because I'm a hostage to my bride
I'm my own volition
I've been a saint, I've been the truth, I've been the lie

I am asking for 
But in the all this trouble I've met
I haven't got one single regret, no

A new day you can go, you can do anything you wanna
It's your place, wing low, go high
Anywhere you wanna
You can reach for the moon
Anywhere your dreams can take you
Go astray, fade away
Just leave it to

No tomorrow without a yesterday

Goodbye to yesterday

On the mouth of the river
Oh the mouth of the river

I want to live a life like that
Live the life of the faithful one
Wanna bow to the floor
With everybody else want to be someone
I want to make some love
I don't want no enemies
It's the curse of a man
Always living life, living live, living just to please

With the hands of a sinner

I'm overboard

And I'm anxious
Oh I'm self-assured

Imagine Dragons,"Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun', thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun', thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the back seat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nose bleeds

Thunder
Thunder, thun', thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun', thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder

All this distance taking is a toll
Speaking volumes
Silence screaming over your words

I never did you right, I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I want to try again

Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Before it's over, over

Cold nights, cold sheets
One more lonely empty hotel room
What I'd give to
Find my way back into you

I never did you right, and I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I want to try again

Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Before it's over, over

Can we start over?
Can we get closer?
Can we start over?
Before it's over, over

Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
